<title>emudev - Emulator Development for educational and preservation purposes</title>

<body>
<h1>emudev</h1>
<p>A network of people interested in the documentation, emulation, simulation and re-implementation of hardware near extinction</p>
<p>The purpose of this organization is the preservation of platforms that have been designed or used for gaming and other artistic 
endeavors. Think of it as an attempt to tackle the hardware side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">abandonware</a>.</p>

<p>The primary goals are
<ul>
<li>Collection, integration/unification and publication of previously hardware documentation in a standarised format as well as further improvement of such material via reverse engineering and testing</li>
<li>Publication of "proof" of said documentation in the form of tests that clearly replicate the documented behavior, in a sandarised format designed for easy 3rd party replication of results</li>
<li>Development of validation suites designed for validation of software and hardware implementations based on avaiable tests featuring multiple "conformance levels"</li>
<li>Development of software that provides a reference implementation of said hardware</li>
<li>Development of hardware and software cores that implement said hardware</li>
<li>Development of compitable replacements for firmware/bios of said hardware, including documentation, tests and validation suites</li>
<li>Operate in fully transparent manner (including publishing full contributor, expenses and donations/incomes data)</li>
<li>Make all information, source code and designs avaiable for no cost and liberal licenses (MIT-style)</li>
<li>Strive to document (and possibly avoid) legal complications arrising from implementation of published designs in a 'we are not laywers' way</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>This effort is not related to piracy. You will not find binaries/roms here.</p>
<p>For now we'll use <a href="http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?channels=%23emudev&Login=Login">#emudev/efnet</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emudev">r/emudev</a> for related discussions</p>
